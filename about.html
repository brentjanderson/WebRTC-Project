                    <p>Hi, My name is Brent. I'm an information systems professional studying information systems management at Brigham Young University. I work at <a href="http://bwww.blenderbottle.com" target="_blank">BlenderBottle</a>, moonlight at <a href="http://www.juicydevelopment.com/" target="_blank">Juicy Development</a>, and spend my weekends volunteering with <a href="http://www.farpointstation.org/" target="_blank">Farpoint</a>.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, reading, and playing the Ukulele.</p>

                <h2>What's your background?</h2>
                <p>I started coding on an Apple II GS Woz Edition as an 8-year old, and have been cutting code ever since. Although I started out with simple ProDOS Basic apps, I eventually started coding for hire at age 14, working on porting a video game engine in C++ from Windows to Mac OS. I also took over technology and software development at the Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center (CMSEC) in Pleasant Grove, UT. There I developed networked simulation software for a distributed, futuristic, immersive video game that operates as the centerpiece for a K-12 field trip experience.</p>
                <p>In 2008, I started Juicy Development, an app and technolgoy development and consulting company that has developed applications for international brands and local startups. Our flagship products, Police Scanner and Talk Radio, have enjoyed time on the iTunes top 100 and top 10 lists, and we regularly consult and contract with other organizations to develop applications for in-house and consumer use.</p>

                <h2>Why WebRTC?</h2>
                <p>One of my current side projects involves developing media rich communications experiences that need to be both performant and easy to deploy and use over the web. Part of this experience also includes real-time video processing for various effects like green screen and voice distortion. I hope that in developing this website I will be able to make some progress on that project while also fulfilling a more academic requirement.</p>
